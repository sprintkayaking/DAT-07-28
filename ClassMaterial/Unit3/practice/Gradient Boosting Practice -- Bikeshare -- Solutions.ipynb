    "\n",
    "This is your chance to think about ways to better capture the value and impact of time and other variables on the target variable (`count`).\n",
    "\n",
    "What you should do here is add a new feature to your training and validation set, re-run your model on the  training set, and score it on the validation set to see if it made an improvement.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A good place to start with this is extracting out different date parts to see if they improve your validation score.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find information about the different dateparts in pandas here:  https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.24/reference/series.html#time-series-related\n",
    "\n",
    "Or if you're using the `datetime` column as an index:  https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.23.4/generated/pandas.DatetimeIndex.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep features if they improve your validation score, discard them if they don't.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few other ideas:  \n",
    "\n",
    " - you can create a column called `Daytime` that tests whether or not it's light outside.  (Ie, between 7PM - 7AM is `False`, `True` otherwise).  You could also get fancier and adjust the daylight hours depending on season.  \n",
    "\n",
    " - you can also create a variable that tracks the passage of time.  This can be done by finding the earliest date in the dataset, subtracting each observed date from that and extracting the datepart in days.  This way, if you have an upward or downward trend throughout the dataset, you'd be able to capture it. So something like `X_train['time'] = (X_train.index.hour - earliest_date).days` \n",
    " - You could also try multiplying different columns together.  Maybe it being `Daytime`, `Sunny` and low humidity has a multiplicative effect that isn't totally captured by any of the variables by themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Dateparts, despite being numbers, are probably best thought of as **categorical** variables.....think about it -- the 11 AM hour is something distinct from the 11 PM hour.....they are best interpreted as being separate categories than one continuous column."
