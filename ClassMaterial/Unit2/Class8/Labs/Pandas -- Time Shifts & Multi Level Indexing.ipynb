    "### Pandas Lab: Time Shifts & Multi Level Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is designed to introduce you to working with time in a more granular way, and understanding how to build features when your data has hierarchies or panels.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ie, when you have repeated observations for the same objects.  This is an important concept because lots of statistical methods don't explicitly account for values which might naturally be correlated with one another over time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But lots of data **is** highly correlated over time!  \n",
    "\n",
    "By the time you're done with this lab, you'll have built 9 columns that capture a variety of information about how an observed value is changing with respect to itself."

    "**Hints:**\n",
    " - Merging on multi-level indices is tricky and prone to failure.  To make this a little bit easier, just use `reset_index()` to pop out the date column in the multi-index, and merge on it as if it were a regular column.\n",
    " - Make sure both date columns are actually encoded as dates, rather than strings, or else the merge won't work.\n",
