    "### Pandas Lab: Time Shifts & Multi Level Indexing\n",

    "\n",
    "Ie, when you have repeated observations for the same objects.  This is an important concept because lots of statistical methods don't explicitly account for values which might naturally be correlated with one another over time.  \n",
